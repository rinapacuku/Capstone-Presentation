# The Human Risk on the Highest Peaks

This repository contains the final presentation for my Digital Futures Capstone Project, **“The Human Risk on the Highest Peaks”**.

## Project Overview
High-altitude mountaineering above 8000 meters has long been considered one of the most dangerous human endeavours. This project investigates whether these extreme peaks have become safer to climb over time, despite a significant increase in the number of expeditions.

Using historical expedition data, the project analyses long-term trends in:
- Climbing attempts and summit success
- Fatality rates
- Causes of death
- The role of supplemental oxygen in reducing altitude-related risk

The analysis focuses on four 8000+m peaks located in Nepal:
- Annapurna I  
- Dhaulagiri I  
- Makalu  
- Kangchenjunga  

## Data Source
The analysis is based on data from **The Himalayan Database**, a comprehensive archive documenting Himalayan expeditions, climbers, and outcomes since the early 1900s.

## Key Findings
- The number of climbers attempting 8000m peaks has increased dramatically over the last century.
- Despite this increase, overall mortality rates have decreased.
- Illness-related deaths, particularly those linked to altitude sickness (AMS, HAPE, HACE), have declined significantly.
- Increased use of supplemental oxygen, improved equipment, and better acclimatisation practices strongly correlate with reduced physiological risk.
- Environmental hazards such as avalanches, rockfall, and crevasse falls remain a persistent and unpredictable danger.
